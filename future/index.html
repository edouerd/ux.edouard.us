  <p class="lh-copy i ph1 ph2-ns">FUTURE WORKS</p>

  <p class="lh-copy f1">
    In the most sincere manner, I deeply wish for an all–around better,<br>
    more futuristic, <br> more egalitarian, <br> more ecologically-friendly world.
  </p>
  <p class="lh-copy ph1 ph2-ns measure">
    In approaching problems that span from the smallest to the most massive scales, and involve tackling deep systems–problems that no singular “design” alone can possibly fix, I remain optimistic that there is truly good work left to be done — work that will actually leave everyone and the planet(s!) better off.
  </p>

  <p class="lh-copy ph1 ph2-ns b">Larger–scale works I think about all the time:</p>

  <ol class="lh-copy ph1 ph2-ns">
    <li>Physical–digital product systems for colonists on Mars</li>
    <li>Building a Network of the Dead, a dynamic relation–construction of dead folks</li>
    <li>Open source learning (self-actualization) networks</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="lh-copy ph1 ph2-ns b">Subjects I’ve recently been curious about, and have begun to seriously research:</p>

  <ol class="lh-copy ph1 ph2-ns">
    <li>New hegemonic formats of communication, “The New American Interface”</li>
    <li>Virtual reality web browsing, or how we can break the glowing rectangle</li>
    <li>Manufacturing methodologies, and how they can be easily communicated</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="lh-copy ph1 ph2-ns b">I’m tinkering with these things:</p>

  <ol class="lh-copy ph1 ph2-ns">
    <li>Computerless Website Creation</li>
    <li>Physical affordance recontextualisation, imbuing simple objects with prior memories</li>
  </ol>

  <p class="lh-copy ph1 ph2-ns b pb5">More later</p>
