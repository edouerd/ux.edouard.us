Hi!

This is the source for [ux.edouard.us](http://ux.edouard.us/), which a facet of my main presence, [edouard.us](https://edouard.us/). Breaking up presentation in this manner allows me to distinctly display subsets of my practice in a way that best suits them, I believe. This site was built with [Jekyons](https://tinychime.github.io/jekyons/), my favorite way (so far) to rapidly stand up a static website.

If you'd like to view this site locally, or base your own work off of it, simply make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on your machine, and proceed with the following in your terminal of choice:

1. `git clone` this repository
2. `cd` to the cloned directory
3. input these in sucession:
  - `npm install`
  - `bundle install`
  - `jekyll build`
  - `gulp` will run the site automatically in your browser, via BrowserSync
4. type <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to quit the process

Have fun, have a good time.
