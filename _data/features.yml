  description: "Often, I think about the future — The future of our planet, the future of humanity, my future, etc. Sometimes these thoughts resolve into small one-off expressions in the form of a sketch, and other times I begin larger projects that express ideal future states for a given topic. At the moment I'm thinking a lot about death, Mars and space travel, new movements in interface design, cybernetics, and the union of hardware and software design into a cohesive whole."
